## Churn Analysis using Power BI
This repository contains a Power BI project for analyzing churn data from a call center dataset. The dataset includes information about customers who have churned and their corresponding data points such as tenure, phone service, internet service, contract type, and payment method. The Power BI project provides visualizations and insights on the data to help stakeholders understand the factors influencing churn and take appropriate actions to prevent it. The target variable is "Churn" which indicates whether a customer has left the company or not.

## How to Use
To use this repository, you can clone or download it to your local machine. The Power BI file used for the analysis is included in the repository for reference. You can open the Power BI file and interact with the visualizations to see the data analysis performed on the dataset.

## Data Source
